          The Nintendo Wii was the first video game console I ever owned; my
          parents gifted it to me for Christmas in 2010. For a long time, the
          only three games I owned were Mario Kart Wii, Super Mario Galaxy, and
          Super Paper Mario. I got a lot of mileage out of those three games and
          I love them to death. Nevertheless, every Walmart trip I would find
          myself back in the Nintendo section, trying out the available demos
          and scoping out what my next game would be. I always remember one
          particular game standing out in the demos: Donkey Kong Country
          Returns. Specifically, I would replay the one level with a giant tidal
          wave crashing into the foreground and the octopus wreaking havoc
          everywhere. That level became imprinted in my mind, and I knew I had
          to play the rest of the game. Unfortunately, I never ended up getting
          the game, and so DKC Returns would remain an unrequited desire.

          Fast forward almost 15 years and I still never had the opportunity to
          play the game. As new consoles and games came out, DKC Returns fell
          lower and lower down my list of games to play, especially once I
          played Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze. With the announcement of
          the remaster of Donkey Kong Country Returns a few months ago, I
          decided it was finally my time to play the game myself. Rather than
          spending $60 on a glorified remaster, I decided to purchase the
          original game from somebody online for $20. That $40 difference was
          well worth the slightly worse graphics and missing a few levels from
          the 3DS game.

          Like most platformers, DKCR’s story is simple: the Tiki Tak Tribe has
          taken over Donkey Kong Island so Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong must
          venture throughout the island to stop the Tiki minions and reclaim
          their land and bananas. I love the Tiki Tak villains in this game.
          They all have cool designs – created to mimic musical instruments –
          and I was always excited to hear their melodies before each boss
          fight. All the worlds are straight-forward; forest, beach, jungle, and
          volcano, to name a few. The Factory creating more Tiki minions and the
          Cliff with all of its dinosaur fossils were stand-outs for me.
          Although the game plays it safe with world ideas, DKCR separates
          itself from other platformers in how it brings each level within the
          worlds to life. This game is packed with so many fun ideas to keep the
          world engaging and exciting to play through. The player finds
          themselves in plenty of interesting situations, from infiltrating an
          enemy ship to trying to escape from a crumbling temple. DKCR uses the
          background in clever ways as well, such as sending the player further
          back to platforms in the distance, or having rocks rolling into the
          foreground for the player to dodge. “Floating” platforms are rare in
          this game as almost every platform is a part of the level’s scenery.
          Rather than random floating blocks, you’re jumping on tree canopies or
          hopping from one cooled lava section to the next. It does a great job
          of investing the player in the world. David Wise and team once again
          hit a home run with the soundtrack once again. Each song perfectly
          captures the atmosphere and vibe of the levels, from the serene
          Aquatic Ambience to the adrenaline-pumping Gear Getaway theme.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.p}>
          Every level has its own unique mechanic and theme so it never feels
          like you’re just replaying the same level over and over again. The
          game also mixes the platforming levels with mine carts, rocket barrel,
          and Rambi levels so you’re not just jumping left and right the entire
          time. Riding Rambi is satisfying since you can aimlessly ram through
          enemies and obstacles without concern, and I get an adrenaline rush
          during the mine cart levels as I carefully hop from cart to cart
          nonstop. The rocket barrel levels are some of my favorites in the
          entire game. You need to weave through flying obstacles while the
          level transforms around you; they’re truly a spectacle to fly through
          and witness. Not every level’s mechanic is a winner, some of them can
          be boring to traverse through. Regardless, a majority of the levels
          are all winners.

          I played the entire game using just a standard wii remote. The wii
          remote definitely feels a bit dated. My hands would get cramped after
          playing for a while, and I had some trouble with inputs trying to
          click a button and shake the remote at the same time. Sometimes I
          would roll when I actually wanted to blow a candle out. Running,
          jumping, and rolling around as Donkey Kong feels great, and having
          Diddy Kong to give me a couple seconds of extra air time was a
          blessing. One pet peeve I had is that some of the levels felt
          especially difficult without Diddy Kong. The first temple level, for
          example, took me dozens of tries just with Donkey Kong, but then I
          went back and did it with Diddy Kong and it became significantly
          easier. It serves as a good challenge if people are looking for one,
          but I wish there was a better way of getting Diddy Kong without having
          to enter another random level to retrieve him. The items in Cranky
          Kong’s shop are really useful; the banana juice is especially strong
          during boss battles. Since I spent so many tries trying to beat the
          first temple level, I had more than enough banana coins for the rest
          of the game.

          The bosses are hit or miss in this game. While they are all
          interesting in concept, some of them aren’t as fun to fight. The crab
          trio is pretty simple and they have odd hitboxes. The Mole Miner is
          also a cool boss in theory, but it has a very small margin for error
          making it more frustrating. The final boss is especially annoying
          since you usually have Diddy Kong for boss battles, but if you die and
          respawn you have no way of getting Diddy Kong back. If you want to get
          him back for the final boss, you must leave the level and restart from
          the rocket entrance section and then return to the boss. I ended up
          just fighting the boss with two hearts and no Diddy Kong since I
          didn’t want to have to redo the entire rocket part beforehand. It made
          the boss a lot more difficult, but I managed to beat it eventually. I
          enjoyed hunting the KONG collectables in every level, especially since
          I was incentivized to unlock the temples in each world. The temples
          were fun, tough challenges at the end of every world, and the final
          level was a satisfying end to the temples. I didn’t go out of my way
          to get every single puzzle piece, but they’re a good excuse to return
          to levels in the future.

          Donkey Kong Country Returns was the foundation for bringing the Donkey
          Kong Country series to the modern age of gaming, similar to New Super
          Mario Bros for the Super Mario Bros series. It takes what made the
          previous games great and evolves it with a bunch of thrilling ideas.
          The game can be unnecessarily difficult, especially when there’s no
          option to use Diddy Kong in many levels. In a post-Tropical Freeze
          world, it’s hard to recommend this game when Tropical Freeze does
          everything better. Regardless, I had a good time playing through the
          game and making my childhood dreams come true.
