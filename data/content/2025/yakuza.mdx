I don’t think I could ever get tired of the sheer whimsy the
Yakuza games bring. I imagine the brainstorming session for
Yakuza: Like A Dragon consisted of a dozen people shouting out
the most bizarre sidequest ideas imaginable, and whoever was in
charge refused to turn down a single one.

A kart-racing tournament with a full storyline? Sounds fun.

Dozens of exams spanning a wide range of subjects? Sure, why
not.

What if the protagonist had a pet crawfish? Incredible.

A full blown business management campaign to become Yokohama’s
#1 company? Absolutely.

The Yakuza franchise easily has my favorite sidequests and
minigames in any JRPG I’ve played. You truly never know what the
game is going to throw at you next. I was especially floored by
how much I enjoyed the business management minigame. I went in
fully expecting to skip it since it sounded dry and tedious, but
after giving it an honest shot, I became completely obsessed. I
ended up playing it for eight hours straight until I finally
claimed the #1 spot. And that’s without even touching on the
main story, which I enjoyed far more than Infinite Wealth’s
narrative. I love the rhythm of the game: watching 45-minute
emotionally charged cutscenes; diving into cinematic,
over-the-top yakuza brawls; then immediately pivoting into the
goofiest sidequests imaginable.

Ichiban Kasuga is one of my favorite heroes in any game. His
sincerity, optimism, and willingness to fully commit to even the
most ridiculous situations make him endlessly lovable. I can’t
wait to see where the series takes him next, but for now, I’m
beyond excited to try out Yakuza 0 in 2026.
