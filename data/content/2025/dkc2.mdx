Donkey Kong has been one of my favorite platforming franchises
ever since I played Tropical Freeze on my Wii U. I played the
original Donkey Kong Country a few years later, but never
ventured beyond that – until this year. While I didn’t love the
original DKC and felt it had aged noticeably, I’d heard nothing
but praise for its sequel, Donkey Kong Country 2, so I was
excited to finally give it a shot.

Despite its namesake, DKC2 has you playing as Diddy Kong and
Dixie Kong on a journey to rescue Donkey Kong after he’s been
kidnapped by King K. Rool. The game begins aboard K. Rool’s
ship, where the first game left off, and takes you through a
variety of areas on your way to save DK. While the level design
in the first game was fine, very few stages stuck with me after
I finished. In DKC2, however, nearly every area introduced
memorable and creative ideas that kept things fresh throughout.

Dixie Kong’s hair-glide ability is a fantastic evolution of the
series’ movement, complementing Diddy’s agility while opening up
new level design possibilities. There’s also a much greater
emphasis on animal buddies this time around! While Winky and
Expresso are sorely missed, the new additions – Rattly,
Squitter, Clapper, Glimmer, and Squawks – are all implemented
exceptionally well. Squawks quickly became my favorite; I loved
the speed and freedom of his flying levels, with Squitter coming
in as a close second once I got the hang of his web mechanics.

Some standout levels include the minecart stage where you’re
chased by a ghostly skeleton, the level where you ride Rambi
through a honeycomb, and all the bramblebush sections. I also
made the decision to collect every DK coin, which gave me a
great excuse to revisit several stages. The music is another
highlight, serving as a phenomenal follow-up to the original
game’s already excellent soundtrack.

Donkey Kong Country 2 perfectly scratched the 2D platforming
itch I had after finishing Donkey Kong Bananza, and now I
understand why it’s considered one of the most beloved entries
in the franchise.
