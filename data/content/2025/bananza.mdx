I MUST SPEAK MY TRUTH: I LOVE DONKEY KONG BANANZA!

Donkey Kong Bananza is the most satisfying game I’ve played this
year and my favorite 3D Platformer since Astro Bot. Donkey
Kong’s absurdly strong ability to punch through nearly any
surface is endlessly entertaining. I spent hours smashing
through dirt, stone, and every other destructible material I
could find.

While I liked Bananza during my first playthrough, I didn’t
truly fall in love with it until I committed to the full
collectathon: all **777 bananas**, **696 fossils**, and
**110 music discs** scattered throughout the planet’s many
layers. That hunt pushed me to explore every area to its fullest
extent. While I spent about 20 hours finishing Bananza’s main
story, reaching 100% completion took closer to 40 hours, and not
once did it feel like wasted time.

The Bananza transformations make traversal feel effortless. I
was constantly hopping to higher grounds, flying between
landmasses, or speeding across massive fields in pursuit of the
next collectable. Elephant Bananza and Kong Bananza’s sheer
power let me obliterate any obstacle in my way, and with the
amount of gold I was picking up, the abilities practically paid
for themselves. The rehearsals were a surprising and welcomed
endgame challenge, pushing me to truly master each Bananza
transformation, and the final level felt like a perfect reward
for collecting every last fossil and banana.

Pauline and Donkey Kong made a delightful, heartwarming duo.
Watching their relationship grow as they traveled deeper into
the planet was one of the game’s highlights. Small touches, like
brief conversations before going to sleep, did much to showcase
their awesome friendship. I never got tired of hearing Pauline
during Bananza transformations, and her final song, Heart of
Gold, still makes me tear up every time.

The developers absolutely nailed the ending. King K. Rool’s
long-awaited return caught me completely off guard – I was
bamboozled yet again by that rotten crocodile – but it only made
the finale more satisfying. It’s easy to dismiss Donkey Kong
Bananza as just a game about punching and destruction, but doing
so ignores the incredible care, creativity, and polish poured
into every layer of its world. I can confidently say that Donkey
Kong Bananza is my favorite 3D Platformer Nintendo has ever
made, and I sincerely hope we get to see Donkey Kong & Pauline
team up again in the future.
