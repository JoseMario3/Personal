_“I am not your son. I am the Ghost.”_

Jin Sakai is undoubtedly my favorite hero this year – an
honorable man forced to abandon the samurai code he’s lived by
his entire life in order to save the island he calls home.
Haunted by past failures in the past and crushed beneath
impossible odds, Jin takes desperate, often brutal measures to
drive out the loathsome Mongol invaders.

That powerful narrative is paired with Ghost of Tsushima’s
breathtaking world, easily one of the most gorgeous landscapes
I’ve ever explored in a game. When I wasn’t sitting jaw-dropped,
soaking in the scenery, I was fully absorbed in its thrilling
katana combat. I loved the balance between stealth, silently
dismantling Mongol camps, and the intensity of open combat,
where juggling sword stances became essential once the horde
closed in. The Iki Island DLC was another standout, adding
meaningful depth to Jin’s character and confronting him with the
emotional scars he’d long buried. It enriched his arc without
undermining the core story, making his internal struggle feel
even more personal.

My biggest nitpick is that I never felt particularly motivated
to pursue most side content. The Shinto and Inari Shrines became
repetitive fairly quickly, and the combat was forgiving enough
that I rarely felt compelled to hunt for upgrades. While I did
finish all the character side quests, I never formed a strong
attachment to any of their stories.

Even so, Jin Sakai’s journey – walking the razor-thin line
between honor and survival – will stay with me for a long time.
His transformation into the Ghost isn’t just compelling; it’s
unforgettable.
