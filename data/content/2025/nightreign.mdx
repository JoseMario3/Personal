Elden Ring Nightreign is not a perfect game. In fact, it may be
the most frustrating roguelike I’ve ever played. Every mission
takes at least 40 minutes to reach the final boss, only to end
about twenty seconds later when your team is wiped out by one of
the Nightlords. Nightreign’s saving grace (pun intended) however
is its multiplayer.

In college, I learned the term “trauma bonding” while struggling
with friends through classes like Intro to Microelectronics and
Analysis of Algorithms, and that concept applies perfectly here.
Playing Nightreign with friends turns an otherwise rage-inducing
experience into something far more entertaining. Over the course
of 100+ hours, my high school friends and I managed to defeat
all of the Nightlords and a handful of the Everdark Sovereigns.
Early on, I gravitated toward Duchess and never looked back. Our
win/lose ratio is atrocious, but we had a great time regardless.

Surprisingly, playing with random people online wasn’t nearly as
bad as I expected. We were either thrilled to get a competent
teammate or amused paired with less-skilled players. I also
loved seeing which bosses they pulled from Elden Ring and the
Dark Souls series; it’s been too long since I’ve fought Smelter
Demon and Dancer of the Boreal Valley. The Nightlords are some
of the most epic bosses in Soulsborne history. My favorites
include Adel, Baron of Night; Libra, Creature of Night; and
Heolstor, the Nightlord.

It’s still a shame that the developers never added crossplay to
the game. Regardless, there have been so many highlights, from
frantic last-second rescues in the storm to immediately
sprinting the other way whenever the Bell-Bearing Hunter
appeared. Even now, I’m beyond excited to hop back in with
friends and sink more time into Nightreign with the new DLC.
