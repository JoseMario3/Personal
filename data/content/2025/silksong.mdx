After a nearly seven-year wait, Hollow Knight: Silksong finally
released on September 4, 2025, and I dropped everything to play
it. For two straight weeks, my life followed a single routine:
go to work, then play Silksong. From September 4th to September
20th, all other hobbies were shelved and socializing was reduced
to the bare minimum. I didn’t stop until I reached 100%
completion, and in sixteen days I logged 90 hours of playtime.
Only two other games claimed more of my time this year: Persona
3 Reload (a 90-hour JRPG plus its DLC) and Elden Ring
Nightreign, a multiplayer experience I returned to throughout
the year. I spent a long time debating whether I preferred Clair
Obscur: Expedition 33 or Silksong, but there’s no denying the
absolute chokehold Silksong had on my life for those two
consecutive weeks.

Hollow Knight Silksong is everything I wanted from a sequel to
Hollow Knight. Pharloom is a massive world packed with hidden
items, branching paths, and memorable bosses. Every time I
thought I’d uncovered most of the map, it simply kept expanding.
The Citadel lived up to every whispered promise from Act I, and
Act III recontextualized earlier regions in ways that reignited
my desire to explore even further.

Hornet’s acrobatic moveset is significantly more challenging,
and more rewarding, than the Knight’s. Some mechanics, like the
new dash timing and dive attack, took time to get used to, but
once they clicked, combat became exhilarating. I spent most of
the game using the Beast Crest embracing the aggressive
playstyle it encouraged. Silksong’s difficulty is no joke.
Double damage, a limited health pool, and enemies with
intricate, punishing movesets demanded constant focus. While
many people were understandably deterred by its difficulty, I
dug in my heels and powered my way forward. I died constantly,
in every possible situation, but I always got back up. The Coral
Tower gauntlet was the one point where I nearly gave up, but
after stepping away for a day, I came back and conquered it.

There were countless standouts moments in Silksong that made
this an amazing experience. My favorite was the heart-pounding
ascent back to Pharloom, the volcano erupting right on my tail
while Enter Pharloom played in the background. I loved The Slab
segment of being kidnapped, stripped of my gear, and forced to
break free. I spent far too long climbing Cogwork Core for the
first melody, and Mount Fay proved to be an equally brutal and
satisfying platforming challenge. Defeating Groal the Great,
First Sinner, and Skarrsinger Karmelita left me invigorated. Of
course, I can’t forget the grand spectacle that was Trobbio’s
performances and sparring against Phantom while the organ
thundered in the background.

Pharloom feels alive. NPCs are scattered everywhere, and I was
always eager to return to Bellhart or Songclave to see how the
world evolved. Running into Sherma or Shakra along the way
always brought a smile to my face. I appreciated that Silksong
presents its story more openly than Hollow Knight, while still
offering deep lore through conversations with townsfolk.

Hornet was a far more engaging protagonist than the Knight.
Having a lead character who actively speaks and connects with
others was refreshing. Her journey culminates in a powerful
reflection on her past in Hallownest, grounding the story
emotionally. The final battle against Lost Lace at the bottom of
the void was demanding, emotional, and utterly fitting, and the
ending was a beautiful callback to the original game.

Despite its divisive reception, I’m unwavering in my love for
Hollow Knight: Silksong. No other game held my attention the way
Silksong did, and I would replay the entire journey again in a
heartbeat.
