How do you follow up a game made entirely of yarn? You double
down and handcraft the whole world. My sister and I played
Yoshi’s Woolly World together on the Wii U, and this year we
finally got to play its follow-up, Yoshi’s Crafted World. This
is undoubtedly one of the cutest and most creative games I
played all year. Cardboard floors, fabric Yoshis, clay enemies,
origami platforms — every piece of the world looks lovingly
handmade. Yoshi can now wear fun costumes in each level, from
juice box cartons and cardboard mice to little tin cans and
coffee creamer armor. Half the fun for me and my sister was
picking out these silly costumes before every level. The game
introduces a plethora of fun new level ideas while keeping the
same amusing multiplayer mechanics as the previous game, like
stealing each other’s eggs or launching one another to reach
tricky spots. Some of our favorite levels included the safari
level, the bakery world, and the Mega Cardboard Yoshi beatdowns.

My sister and I had a great time running through the whole game
once, but I wouldn’t recommend trying to 100% complete it. After
beating a level, an NPC sends you back to the level on scavenger
hunts to find various items in the background & foreground. At
first, we tried to complete every task, but constantly replaying
levels became exhausting – some required up to eight trips just
to satisfy the NPC. A more enjoyable reason to revisit levels is
the “flip side”, where you progress from Finish to Start
searching for three Poochy pups. Unlike the monotonous scavenger
hunts, the Poochy search stayed engaging, offering a fresh
perspective on familiar stages. The soundtrack, unfortunately,
isn’t quite as inspired as the previous game’s. The main level
theme track repeats across most levels, and the overall score
feels rather sleepy. Even so, despite the repetitive completion
tasks and average soundtrack, playing through Yoshi’s Crafted
World with my sister is a memory I’ll always treasure.
