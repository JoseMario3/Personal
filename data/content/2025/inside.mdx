The fun didn’t stop with Limbo, because on the same day I also
played through Inside, another short but intriguing
puzzle-platformer. If Limbo’s story left me confused, Inside’s
narrative downright baffled me. You start the game as a kid
running from the police, and you end it as an amalgamation of
human bodies rolling down a mountain after escaping a research
facility. Along the way, the kid uses a mind-control helmet to
gather humans, dives deep underwater in a submarine being chased
by some phantom-like entity, and goes through countless other
bizarre events for reasons I couldn’t explain. The sheer shock
factor of Inside’s sequence of events put it above Limbo on this
list. Experiencing both bewildering narratives in a single
afternoon was a great time, and I’ll definitely be looking up
more interpretations in the future.
