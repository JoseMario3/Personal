I had a difficult time deciding which game I preferred. Both are
excellent in their own ways, and I knew that wherever I placed
one, the other would have to sit right next to it. After much
reflection, I ultimately chose Part II as my favorite. I know
its story is highly controversial, but the narrative worked for
me. I loved the new setting of Seattle, a city I’m already
fairly familiar with. The gunplay is just as strong as in the
first game, featuring even scarier encounters and a wider
selection of weapons. The music perfectly suits the atmosphere,
and the graphics are the most realistic I’ve seen in any game.

That said, the real reason I chose Part II over Part I is due to
how impressed I am Abby won me over. Even though it had been
spoiled for me, Joel’s death is still the second most
gut-wrenching death I’ve experienced in a video game. I was
fully invested in Ellie’s revenge quest and adamantly opposed
anything involving Abby. I nearly gagged when I realized half
the game would force me to play from her perspective. Still, I
pushed forward and, against my will, slowly began to warm up to
her.

It’s fascinating how stepping into another person’s shoes can
humanize them. I couldn’t help but care for Abby after watching
her evolve through her unlikely alliance with Lev. She also gets
some of the game’s strongest gameplay sequences, particularly
the Rat King encounter and The Island. By the end, Ellie began
to feel more like the villain. I respect the decision not to let
the player choose the ending – sometimes that choice simply
doesn’t fit the story being told. I reflected on Ellie and
Abby’s opposing perspectives long after finishing the game, and
that’s ultimately why I chose The Last of Us Part II over Part
I.
