I’ve entered the past couple of years with a relatively clear
idea of which games I wanted to tackle. For example, going into
2025, I knew I wanted to play Persona 3 Reload, The Last of Us,
Yakuza: Like A Dragon, and Ghost of Tsushima, among a few other
titles. It’s impossible to predict everything I’ll end up
playing, though, and The Messenger was one game that completely
caught me by surprise. While casually browsing Nintendo’s E-Shop
(as I far too often do), I found it on sale for a whopping $3. I
couldn’t ignore a deal that good, and so it received an express
ticket to the very top of my backlog.

First things first: The Messenger’s 8-bit and 16-bit soundtracks
are incredible, nearly rivaling Shovel Knight’s fantastic music.
Every area delivers hit after hit: from the
_Hill of Destiny_ to _A Home Amongst the Clouds_, the
stellar finale of _A Melody to Break the Curse_, and even
into the Picnic Panic DLC with _Impact Zone_. The
soundtrack simply doesn’t let up; I added nearly 70 songs from
the game to my video game playlist on Spotify because they’re
all that good.

The Messenger is everything I wanted Cybershadow to be. Unlike
Cybershadow, I genuinely enjoyed the story here, especially the
twist that elevates what could have been a generic narrative.
The lighthearted, comedic writing is among my favorite of the
year – high praise I rarely give to 2D platformers. The ninja
acrobatics and combat feel silky smooth, and the platforming
challenges consistently kept me engaged. The sudden shift into a
Metroidvania structure was a bit jarring, but I’m
well-accustomed to tedious tasks, so it didn’t bother me much.
The DLC provided a great excuse to return to and squeeze out a
few more hours. I had an absolute blast with The Messenger, and
I genuinely hope I find another game that excites me as much as
this one did.
