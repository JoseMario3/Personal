Widely regarded as one of the greatest video game stories ever told, I’ve wanted to play _The Last of Us_ for years. Unfortunately, I didn’t have any way to play it until 2024, so I made do by watching a Let’s Play and later season one of the HBO series. With season two on the horizon, I finally made time to play through both games. I had a great time finally experiencing the story firsthand.

The writers deserve all the praise for the narrative; I loved watching Joel and Ellie’s relationship evolve over the course of their cross-country journey. The mix of stealthy exploration and tense combat against the infected delivered a thrill I haven’t felt since playing Resident Evil 4. The game holds up remarkably well considering it came out twelve years ago. I honestly have very few criticisms; it’s an incredibly solid experience that tells a moving story without overstaying its welcome. Highlights include the final hospital sequence and my first encounter with a Bloater. The Last of Us is definitely a game I can see myself returning to for a replay.
