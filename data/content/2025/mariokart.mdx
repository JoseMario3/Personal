Mario Kart World had enormous pressure on it: Nintendo’s first
truly new Mario Kart entry since 2014, the flagship launch title
for the Switch 2, and the first AAA game to carry an $80 price
tag. While I had a good time with it initially, there are
several areas where it falls short due to some questionable half
measures.

Knockout Tour is an exciting addition to the racing modes, but
it becomes repetitive quickly, with only eight routes and no way
to customize your own path. I love the wide variety of costumes
and new characters (shoutout Cow and Pianta), but randomly
mixing costumes and characters instead of organizing outfits
into folders makes the menu feel unnecessarily cluttered.

The massive mix of new tunes and nostalgic remixes may be the
most impressive soundtrack of the year, but without any volume
settings, the music is often drowned out by rumbling engine
noises and item sound effects. This is especially frustrating in
free-roam mode – the most obvious place to add a radio for
selecting music. As for free-roam itself, it’s an interesting
concept, but I quickly lost interest due to the lack of
meaningful incentives to collect all the P-Switches and Peach
coins. I mostly used it as an efficient way to unlock character
costumes.

That said, a tremendous amount of love and care clearly went
into this game. The character animations are the best in the
series, the world is beautiful and densely detailed, and the new
racing mechanics keep Mario Kart feeling fresh. I don’t think
World will replace Mario Kart 8, but it stands toe-to-toe with
it, offering a different kind of grand experience. I’m hopeful
that some of my complaints will be addressed through DLC
someday, but as it stands, Mario Kart World is a staple for game
nights.
