I told myself I’d play Persona 4 Golden in 2026, but after
enjoying Persona 3 Reload so much, I was eager to finish out the
trilogy. Persona 4 feels far more lighthearted compared to the
darker, gloomier atmosphere of Persona 3. The Investigation Team
ended up being my favorite party of the year. While S.E.E.S.s
interactions were largely focused on exploring Tartarus, the
Investigation Team spends much more time simply enjoying each
other’s company. Cooking dinner, school field trips, camping,
skiing, and putting on a full concert recital all help make
their relationships feel special.

Watching each character confront their truth inside the TV World
was both exciting and bizarre in ways I didn’t expect. The
dungeons in Persona 4 Golden are miles better than Tartarus – I
vividly remember running through the Sauna, Theater, Game, and
Secret Base and taking on their bosses. The classic turn-based
combat returns with added duo attacks for Chie/Yukiko,
Yosuke/Teddie, and Kanji/Naoto. The music is phenomenal as ever,
with Heaven, Time to Make History, and Reach Out To The Truth
standing out as some of my favorites songs of the year.

Released in 2012, Persona 4 Golden does show its age, especially
after finishing Persona 3 Reload. The menus are lackluster, the
dungeons and combat aren’t as refined, and the visuals are the
least exciting in the trilogy. These are minor complaints
though; the characters, world, and story are among the best in
the whole franchise, and I’m confident Persona 4 Revival will
address my graphical concerns.

I was deeply disappointed that the murder mystery was spoiled
early-on. I wish I could erase the game from my memory and
experience it fresh, but even knowing the culprit, I still loved
uncovering the ‘why’ rather than the ‘who.’ I also struggled to
reach the true ending near the endgame, as the required dialogue
choices are extremely specific. It took several attempts and a
few Google searches to avoid the bad ending. The effort was
worth it, though, because the final boss was exhilarating. I
loved my time with Persona 4 Golden, and I have no doubt I’ll
replay it in full when Persona 4 Revival releases.
