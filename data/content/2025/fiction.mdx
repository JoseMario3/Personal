Reflecting on it now, I’m split on Split Fiction. Let’s rewind.
I played it online with a college friend right at launch, and we
had a delightful time together. We made a great duo: he
gravitated toward the more stoic, logical Mio while I naturally
leaned into the upbeat, whimsical Zoe. Mio’s first chapter was a
terrific introduction. The stressful vehicle chases, Parking
Attendant and Mr. Hammer boss fights, and the hilarious CAPTCHA
section instantly hooked me.

Despite how strong that opening chapter was, I barely think back
on the others. A few moments stand out, like the turtle boss in
Chapter 3 and the giant dragon final boss of Chapter 4, but none
of the chapters left the same impression as the first. The side
stories, on the other hand, were a major highlight. Fighting the
Dentist as a tooth and goofing off in the Moon Market are just
two examples of the side stories’ wonderfully creative ideas.

The only other section that matched Chapter 1 for me was the
final boss. Ironically, a game centered on storytelling ended up
having one of my least favorite narratives of the year. Still,
that weaker story set the stage for an excellent showdown
against the evil CEO, Rader. Running through remixed versions of
earlier chapters in a striking blend of sci-fi and fantasy was
incredibly impressive.

In short, my favorite parts of the game were the beginning, the
end, and a handful of side quests along the way. When I look
back on Split Fiction, I remember loving it and thinking it was
really cool, but that “compliment sandwich” may have distracted
me from how lukewarm I felt about the middle sections. Overall,
I still think it is an awesome game packed with great ideas, and
I hold on dearly to the memories of playing it with one of my
best friends.
