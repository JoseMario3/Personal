In another all-too-normal impulsive decision, I bought and
played Limbo in November. It’s a rather short game, but I
enjoyed it nonetheless. The black-and-white art style makes an
already spooky game feel even more ominous. The platforming
puzzles strike a good balance: not too difficult, but still fun
to solve. The story is heavily left up to interpretation, and I
spent most of the game confused about what was happening. I
still need to watch some videos explaining the narrative. In the
end, Limbo was a nice little game, and I’m glad I finally got
around to playing it.
