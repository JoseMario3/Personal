I picked up Ball x Pit after hearing all the buzz around its
release. The developers take the classic brick-breaker formula
and elevate it into a full roguelike experience. The game starts
simply: you control a character who jumps into
brick-breaker-style combat to fend off hordes of enemies and
bosses. It also features a base-building component between runs
– gathering resources and constructing buildings unlocks new
abilities to help deal with the increasingly overwhelming enemy
forces.

The sixteen playable characters keep the gameplay fresh, and
things become even more interesting once you unlock the ability
to bring two characters into a single run. My favorite
combination was The Repentant, whose balls deal 5% more damage
each time they hit a wall, paired with The Cohabitants, which
launch mirrored copies of every ball for even more chaos.

After rolling credits, I didn’t have much desire to keep
actively playing, though I was still interested in upgrading
every building and completing more levels with different
characters. Fortunately, the final unlockable character, The
Radical, literally takes the reins and plays the game itself.
About 20 of my roughly 33 in-game hours came from letting The
Radical play so I could unlock every ability. Overall, Ball x
Pit was a fun, brief experience, but it doesn’t come close to
reaching Balatro’s level for me.
