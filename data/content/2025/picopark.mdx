I don’t even remember where I first learned about the original
Pico Park. My earliest memory is giving it a shot on a random
evening with friends in college, where we spent the entire night
laughing, yelling, and having an absolute blast. When I found
out the developers had made a sequel, I knew I had to be there
on day one.

Pico Park is simple in concept but expertly executed. Everyone
plays as tiny cat-like critters called “Picos,” working together
to complete a series of fun and wacky levels. These levels range
from platforming challenges to Tetris-style puzzles and plenty
of other silly minigames. The game supports up to eight players
simultaneously, and it truly shines the more people you can
gather.

Organizing large groups with varying levels of gaming experience
is surprisingly difficult, but that chaos is exactly what makes
Pico Park 2 so entertaining. I played most of the game with
around six to eight people, and I’m honestly impressed we
managed to clear even half of the levels. The difficulty ramps
up significantly toward the end, so to finish the final stages,
I ended up pairing with a friend and tackling them as a duo. No
friendships have been destroyed due to it (yet), and until then,
Pico Park 2 is a must-play at all of my friends’ game nights.
