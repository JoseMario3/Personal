I bought the original Hades game on a whim during my freshman
spring semester, and my suitemates and I put in over 70 hours in
a single week just to beat it. Since then, I’ve been eagerly
awaiting the full release of Hades II, and my patience was
finally rewarded in September. Supergiant Games absolutely
nailed this sequel. They took everything I loved about the first
game and raised the stakes across the board: more intense
combat, stunning graphics, a wealth of boons, and rocking music.

The dialogue alone is staggering. Even 55 hours in, I haven’t
heard a single repeated line – every NPC has unique, compelling
interactions. I had a blast alternating between underworld and
surface runs, experimenting with new weapons, and daring myself
to crank up the heat. The soundtrack is as phenomenal as ever,
with standout tracks like Sightless Shepherd, Titan of Time,
and, of course, Claw Out Your Eyes. It pains me to see this game
so low on my list, but that just highlights how strong the other
games on this list were. Hades II is an absolute triumph in its
own right.
