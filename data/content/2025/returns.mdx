I’ve been a loyal Nintendo fan since I started gaming. I watched
Let’s Plays of Paper Mario and Majora’s Mask before eventually
getting a Wii for Christmas. A couple years later, I received a
Wii U for Christmas; to this day I can still count on one hand
the number of people I’ve met who also owned one. After that
came a Switch in 2017 and a Switch OLED in 2022. It wasn’t until
I graduated college that I finally branched out from Nintendo
and bought my first PlayStation. As much as I love Nintendo
games, I can’t keep up with the $60 releases every other month.
I usually buy two or three $60+ games a year, but I can’t
justify picking up every big release as much as I’d like to.

Donkey Kong Country Returns is a game I’ve wanted to play since
I was a kid, and when the remaster released this past January, I
knew it was finally time. Instead of buying the overpriced $60
Switch version, I tracked down the original Wii release online
for $20 and played that instead! It was a great way to start the
year and genuinely satisfying to finally fulfill a childhood
wish. While the game shows its age in a few areas, it deserves
credit for laying the groundwork that allowed Tropical Freeze to
shine. I go into more detail in my review of Donkey Kong Country
Returns, so be sure to check that out!
