In an unforeseen turn of events, the wild card on this list,
Lorelei and the Laser Eyes, somehow earned a spot in my top six
games of 2025. I’ve been obsessed with this game ever since
finishing it. Everything from the unsettling atmosphere,
fascinating puzzles to the thought-provoking story captivated me
in a mystery I couldn’t put down. Piecing together the narrative
and watching it all culminate in a climactic finale was one of
my favorite experiences of the year. Lorelei features over 150
puzzles, and while some can be too obscure and others are a bit
too simple, the standout puzzles were among my favorites of 2025. They had me so entranced that I was scribbling solutions
on napkins just to work them out. The game is by no means
perfect – the movement can feel awkward at times, and having
only a single button for every input is a bit silly – but none
of these issues were intrusive enough to ruin the experience.
The only real transgression? I still have no idea what a tampon
does. :(
