What is there to say about Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 that
hasn’t already been said? It’s the most impressive game this
year, racking up over 300 awards and landing second for most
awards won behind Elden Ring. From its picturesque painted
landscapes to its invigorating turn-based/action combat and
awe-inspiring music, every facet of Clair Obscur feels
meticulously crafted. I didn’t truly understand what “Best Game
Direction” meant at The Game Awards until I played this game.
Expedition 33 was clearly built around a strong creative vision,
and the developers executed it perfectly. Every element serves a
purpose in telling a beautiful, cohesive narrative.

For all the recognition I give it now, I wasn’t immediately sold
on Clair Obscur. Much of the early praise I heard focused on how
it modernized turn-based combat with dodge and parry mechanics,
something I was already comfortable with, so I took that acclaim
with a grain of salt. I also wasn’t in the right headspace for a
massive RPG at the time, and I felt fairly lukewarm on Act I and
the start of Act II. After a week-long break, though, the
expedition finally grew on me. Recruiting Monoco, fighting the
two Axons, and ascending the Monolith completely won me over.

The Renoir and Paintress battles are stunning spectacles; I
genuinely would have been satisfied if the Paintress fight had
been the final boss because it was just that good. If I wasn’t
already convinced by how impressive Clair Obscur was, the real
final boss sealed the deal. I’ve never been as torn by a choice
in a video game as I was at the end of Expedition 33. I spent at
least thirty minutes mulling over my decision, and even then I’m
still not convinced I chose correctly. While some of the side
content was a bit easy, I enjoyed completing it all and earning
the platinum trophy. The Simon battle was the most challenging
boss I’ve faced since Malenia in Elden Ring. Clair Obscur:
Expedition 33 is deserving of every award it’s received this
year, and I hope it’s used as a benchmark for games to come.
