No game benefits from a blind playthrough quite like
Inscryption. Honestly, I don’t know how to write about it
without spoiling the very things that make it special. There’s
so much I want to talk about, from the compelling card game to
the memorable characters, but I’d much rather anyone reading
this experience it completely unspoiled. Maybe someday I’ll
write a separate entry where I dig into all my opinions. For
now, I’ll leave it at this: the first 10 hours of Inscryption
were a 10/10 for me, I loved every twist and turn along the way,
and above all else, _listen to the stoat!!!_
