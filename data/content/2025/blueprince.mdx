I saw a YouTube comment recently that read “I hated Blue Prince
just as much as I loved it, which was such a bummer,” and that
perfectly sums up my feelings about the game. I loved the
opening stretch of attempting to reach the Antechamber and
uncover Room 46. The game is shockingly addictive; I spent hours
opening rooms and collecting items. The sheer variety of rooms
and endless mansion layouts kept pulling me back as I chased the
perfect run. I was extremely satisfied when I reached Room 46
after about fourteen hours and watched the credits roll. As any
Blue Prince veteran knows, though, the game is packed with
secrets around every corner, and reaching Room 46 is only the
tip of the iceberg.

The next major challenge is finding the eight sanctum keys that
unlock the underground rooms, and this is where the game began
to lose steam for me. Many keys are locked behind extremely
unlikely conditions, such as reaching the Mechanarium only after
unlocking seven other mechanical rooms, or finding a very
specific vault key and reaching the vault in a single run. These
challenges wouldn’t be as frustrating if not for the heavy
reliance on room RNG. I became more and more discouraged every
run where I wouldn’t get any pieces needed to find the keys. On
top of that, I wasn’t particularly impressed by the game’s
soundtrack, and several puzzles actively annoyed me,
_especially_ the Gallery puzzles.

I’ll admit I got plenty of help from a friend and looked up
multiple puzzle solutions. I didn’t want to waste time solving
something and giving up since I had no idea when I’d see some
rooms again. My frustration isn’t entirely the game’s fault,
though – I frequently heard I should keep a notebook to track
clues, but I was too lazy to commit to it.

That said, there were many puzzles I genuinely enjoyed, like the
Clocktower and the Pipe Room. As an engineer at heart, I loved
the Billiards Room’s math puzzles, and I had fun with the Parlor
room riddles, at least until they became absurdly long. My
friend and I completed all the classrooms and passed the final
exam (yes, we looked up the answers), and I eventually earned
the Full House trophy. My final achievement was collecting all
eight sanctum keys and completing the sigil puzzles (also with
assistance). There were plenty of challenges left, but by then I
was ready to step away.

Despite all my complaints about RNG, I can’t deny that Blue
Prince had me in a chokehold for months. I loved the art style
of this game, and it’s truly astounding how the developers
turned door-opening into such a compelling roguelike. I loved
Blue Prince just as much as I hated Blue Prince, and despite it
all, I still have a nagging itch to return to the game for one
more run.
