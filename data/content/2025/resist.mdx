Hekki Grace! Every year, I have a tradition of buying a small
game on New Year’s Day to carry with me into the year ahead. In
2021, it was Hades; last year, it was Cocoon; and this year’s
pick was 1000xRESIST. Going in, all I really knew was that the
game had a “really engaging story”, and some striking character
designs. As it turns out, “really engaging” is a massive
understatement.

In a year packed with story-driven games, 1000xRESIST stands out
as one of the most unique and compelling narratives I
experienced. You play as Watcher, the blue sister, and slowly
uncover alongside her the story of how the world was destroyed
and rebuilt into what it is today. Gameplay takes a clear
backseat here, and the story is undeniably the main reason I saw
this game through to the end.

The narrative unfolds and reveals itself in an unconventional
way, flipping through time like the pages of a storybook. Some
moments have you exploring old classrooms or drifting through
surreal, liminal spaces, soaring through the air. Outside of
those sequences, however, the gameplay largely consists of
walking and talking. While I was admittedly disappointed by how
minimal the mechanics were, the strength of the story more than
made up for it.

I was especially satisfied with the ending; it doesn’t simply
present a conclusion – it makes sure you understand the message
it’s trying to convey. 1000xRESIST is an experience unique unto
itself. I’m confident I made the right choice bringing this game
with me into the new year, and I can only hope next year’s
tradition lives up to the same standard.
