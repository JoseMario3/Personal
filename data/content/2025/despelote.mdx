Soccer has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember.
I still think back to first grade, when my mom decided to move
me from baseball to soccer. I played on a travel team for nearly
all of elementary and middle school, and in high school I was
back on the field the moment cross country season ended. Growing
up at home, I’d often walk into the living room to find a soccer
match playing on the TV. Even now, I wear a Barcelona charm on
my Crocs and play casual pickup games at the park. When I lace
up my cleats and step onto a field, a switch flips in my brain,
and all the skills and instincts I’ve picked up over the years
come rushing back.

Despelote transported me to Quito, Ecuador in 2001, letting me
see the world through the eyes of a young boy who loves soccer.
The entire city is on edge, as Ecuador teeters on the brink of
qualifying for the 2002 FIFA World Cup. This is the first game
I’ve played that was also an autobiography. Developer Julián
Cordero narrates the experience, guiding us through the city’s
shifting atmosphere month by month while offering glimpses into
his childhood as he explored the world around him.

I loved kicking the ball around with friends, running through
the park, and overhearing fragments of family conversations.
There’s a raw vulnerability to Julián and his family that makes
the game feel deeply authentic. Many moments mirrored my own
childhood – simple experiences like playing outside until my mom
called for dinner, or wandering around a party trying to
entertain myself while the adults talked. My lifelong connection
to soccer kept me fully engaged and made the story resonate even
more. Despelote serves as a beautiful window into a time long
past, captured through an innocent and endearing lens. I only
wish it were longer so I didn’t need to leave the world so soon.
It stands as a perfect reminder that games can be an
extraordinary medium for delivering meaningful, personal works
of art.
