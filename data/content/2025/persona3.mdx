                    Watching the Full Moon, Full Life opening movie every time I
                    started the game

                    Witnessing S.E.E.S. summon their Personas for the first time

                    Finally getting more teammates into Tartarus after a month
                    of only Yukari & Junpei

                    Spending countless days listening to Color Your Night and
                    When the Moon’s Reaching Out Stars while exploring Paulownia
                    Mall and Tatsumi Port Island

                    Hearing Want To Be Close while returning to Iwatodai Dorm
                    after long days of school and socializing

                    Venturing through 200+ floors of Tartarus and defeating
                    hundreds of enemies with It’s Going Down Now blasting in the
                    background
                  Uncovering the secrets of the Kirijo Group and Strega

                    Meeting Aigis on the beach after learning none of the guys
                    have any game
                  Koromaru
                    Akinari, Mutatsu, Maiko, and President Tanaka’s Social Links

                    The intriguing symbolism of death and grief throughout
                    everyone’s stories

                  Discovering just how overpowered Shinji is in combat

                    Activating everyone’s Theurgy skills for the first time

                  “The arcana is the means by which all is revealed.”

                    Experiencing the finale after 100+ in-game hours and bawling
                    my eyes out as Memories of You played and the credits rolled

                All of these moments (and so many more) made Persona 3 Reloadone
                of my favorite JRPGs ever, standing out even after playing seven
                other RPGs throughout the year. Despite some questionable
                gameplay decisions, its story is something truly special, and I
                hope everyone gets the chance to experience it. I’ll leave
                things off with this quote from Mrs. Kamiki:
                  “Take good care of the ones dearest to you. If you wait until
                  their time has come, and you’re clinging to their cold bodies…
                  then it’s too late. …Everyone who’s born will die someday. Not
                  just Akinari, or me, or you. It happens to everyone… So before
                  that happens… It doesn’t take a grand gesture. You don’t have
                  to make a big production of it, but… If you love someone, let
                  them know it. We all go through life with the same struggles,
                  the same heartbreak… We should be able to prop each other up
                  with the same love and kindness as well… I’m sure you have
                  something precious you can share with people… Always remember
                  that…”
