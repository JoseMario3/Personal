In a turn of events no one saw coming, I somehow managed to
squeeze in a full playthrough of Octopath Traveler 2 this year.
I’m especially glad I did, because it was the best JRPG I played
all year. As a strong sequel should, Octopath 2 raises the
stakes and addresses every major issue I had with the first
game. The graphics and HUD have been drastically improved, and
it’s honestly astonishing to return to the original afterward
and see how much it now feels like a beta version of its sequel.
Overall, the characters are wonderful, the graphics are
gorgeous, the music is excellent, and the combat is thrilling;
my only complaints are minor nitpicks. Check out my
retrospective on Octopath Traveler 2 if you want my more
in-depth thoughts.
