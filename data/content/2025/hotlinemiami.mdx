I bought the Hotline Miami Collection a while back during a sale
since it’s often cited as one of the greatest indie game series.
This year, I finally decided to give it a shot. In both games,
you play as a hitman in Miami, receiving jobs over the phone and
executing your targets however you see fit. Every level demands
careful planning and execution against waves of mafia goons.
From punching and shooting to smashing enemies with pipes, the
game is far more violent than I anticipated.

The first game is a solid introduction into the series’
playstyle, with a bewildering yet engaging story to back it up.
The second game refines the formula, increasing the difficulty
and forcing you to think critically about how to clear each
floor. The varied layouts and different masks to wear keep every
level fresh. I loved the sense of accomplishment after finally
making it through a floor after dozens of attempts.

The gameplay reminded me of a top-down Katana Zero, which sounds
backwards, but I just happened to play Hotline Miami second. The
electronic and techno soundtrack perfectly complements the
intense action, and I was completely engrossed running floors
over and over. I struggled plenty, dying constantly, but there
is ample opportunity to improve and chain together bigger combos
if you’re motivated.

The Hotline Miami Collection is incredible as-is, so I’m almost
okay knowing the developer has no plans for a third game. Maybe
someday I’ll return and finally earn a grade higher than a B on
the levels.
