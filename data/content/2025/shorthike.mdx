A majority of the games I play are large-scale action and
adventure experiences. From fighting Shadows in the TV World to
cutting down hordes of Mongols with a katana, it can be a bit
exhausting to jump from one high-intensity game to the next. A
Short Hike was a welcome change of pace from my usual lineup.
It’s a quaint, cozy game about a bird trying to reach the top of
a mountain. Thankfully, this mountain is far less punishing to
climb than Celeste.

The game takes place on a small open-world island (tiny compared
to Elden Ring or Breath of the Wild), but it’s packed with
charm. There are plenty of characters to meet and help along the
way: some are attempting to scale the mountain just like you,
while others are content simply enjoying the park. As you assist
fellow animals and collect golden feathers, you gradually gain
the ability to climb higher and higher.

A Short Hike is a genuinely pleasant experience, elevated by a
peaceful, upbeat soundtrack. It’s the perfect game to sit down
with and get lost in for a couple hours. The characters are all
cute and expressive, and the journey culminates in a
heartwarming conclusion once you finally reach the summit. This
game has been on my radar for a long time, and I’m glad I
finally took the hike.
