Deltarune is a game I definitely want to give a full journal
entry someday, so I’ll keep this brief. While I’m only writing
about chapters 3 and 4 here, my placement on this ranking
reflects all four chapters released so far.

IT’S TV TIME!!! After a nearly four-year hiatus, Deltarune
finally returned with a double feature, and it’s just as good as
I remembered. Chapter 3 opens strong with the introduction of
Tenna, one of my favorite video game characters all year. His
colorful dialogue, popping design, and jubilant show-host
attitude won me over instantly. While the videogame segments
become a bit tedious on repeat playthroughs, the rest of the
chapter is a delight to play. The physical challenges, the
escape from the game show, and the return of Rouxls Kaard all
kept a grin on my face the whole way through. The final battle
against Tenna is the cherry on top, now one of my favorite boss
fights in both Deltarune and Undertale. Naturally, every good
game show has to end eventually. The final physical challenge
against the Roaring Knight delivers a sharp tonal shift to the
chapter and serves as a worthy adversary to test my combat
skills.

Chapter 4 builds directly on that shift. The Dark World feels
noticeably more somber, and the characters’ moods reflect the
looming sense of impending doom. The game still finds moments to
lighten the tone, such as the time-consuming, lengthy battle
against Jackenstein and the wonderful addition of the old man,
Gerson Boom. I loved watching Susie’s character development, and
the Hammer of Justice fight was a fantastic callback to
Undertale. The finale escalates dramatically, with the Roaring
Knight reaffirming their threat before culminating in a
monumental showdown against the Titan.

I love how chapters 3 and 4 work together to tell a cohesive
continuation to Deltarune’s narrative while embracing
drastically different tones. I’m relieved Toby Fox has confirmed
Chapter 5 for 2026 because after that cliffhanger, I don’t think
I could handle a longer wait.
