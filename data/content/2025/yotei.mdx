Even though I hadn’t played its predecessor, Ghost of Yotei was
my most anticipated game going into the year. I had heard plenty
of buzz about Ghost of Tsushima, so I knew I’d enjoy it, and the
Ghost of Yotei trailer at The Game Awards convinced me I had to
play them both in 2025. I managed to beat Tsushima just in time
to play Yotei upon its October release.

In the best way possible, Ghost of Yotei feels more like a movie
than a game. Every region of Ezo is brought to life through
stunning use of color. The fiery reds and oranges of Ishikari
Plains, the silvery, snow-covered peaks of Teshio Ridge, and the
soft pinks and blues splashing across Oshima Coast give each
area a distinct personality. Atsu, the new protagonist, is
fierce, relentless, and unquestionably a worthy successor to Jin
Sakai. Her quest for revenge against the Yotei Six started
slowly after the prologue but quickly accelerated once I began
targeting the Oni and Kitsune. Unlike Jin who relied on a single
weapon, Atsu wields a variety of weapons that keep combat
interesting. My favorites were the Yari, a spear for controlling
distance, and the Kusarigama, a sickle-and-chain combination
perfect for breaking shields and striking from afar. From hidden
waterfalls to the snow-capped summit of Mount Yotei, duels are
always set against breathtaking, cinematic backdrops. My
favorite duel was also the most challenging, and the opponent’s
words are burned into my memory: “Make this duel unforgettable.”

Ghost of Yotei also polished a few minor issues from the first
game. Jin’s armor selection never appealed to me, but I found
myself constantly switching Atsu’s costumes since I loved them
all. Side content felt far more manageable too. While Tsushima’s
world often felt sprawling and overwhelming, Yotei’s compact
layout made exploration and completion satisfying rather than
tedious. I had an amazing time earning the platinum trophy for
Ghost of Yotei, and I’m confident that it’s a worthy successor
to the original game in every way.
