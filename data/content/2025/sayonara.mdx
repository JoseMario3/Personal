There has been an unfortunate lack of rhythm games on my list
this year. Last year, I was introduced to the _Rhythm Heaven_
franchise, and ever since, I’ve been searching for another game
that could give me the same dopamine rush. While I wait for
Rhythm Heaven Groove to release in 2026, Sayonara Wild Hearts
has served as a perfect interim fix!

It’s a relatively short experience (I beat it in one sitting
before lunchtime), but there’s plenty of replayability if you
want to perfect every level. The story follows a heartbroken
girl journeying through a dreamlike world, battling cursed
arcana in order to both heal herself and the world around her.
It’s a simple but charming narrative that ultimately culminates
in her confronting her ‘demons’ and restoring her heart.

The real sauce of the game, however, lies in the game’s
graphics, music, and gameplay. The bold color palette meshes
beautifully with the surreal, polygonal environments, creating a
striking visual identity. Each level has the protagonist chasing
and confronting the cursed arcana in inventive ways – whether
that’s chasing them down on a motorcycle or entering a VR
headset to face them head-on, the variety keeps the experience
consistently fresh and engaging.

As with any rhythm game, the music is the star of the show.
There’s an unmatched satisfaction when your inputs perfectly
sync with the beat. Despite only playing through the game once
over the course of a few hours, tracks like Dead of Night, Mine,
and Begin Again have stayed in my frequent rotation on Spotify.
Sayonara Wild Hearts is an easy game to jump back into whenever
I feel like chasing a perfect run, and I’m sure it’ll live
rent-free in my head for a long time.
